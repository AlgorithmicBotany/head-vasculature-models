# Description
This repository contains computer models for the article: The Hidden Diversity of Vascular Patterns in Flower Heads by Owens et al. (2024).
The models were developed using the Virtual Laboratory (vlab), which can be downloaded from http://algorithmicbotany.org/virtual_laboratory/ or https://github.com/AlgorithmicBotany/vlab.
To start playing with the models, clone this repository to your computer, run vlab's browser program and in the `New browser, Local` window choose the location of the `oofs` folder from your local copy of the repository.
After the new browser window opens, click on `oofs` and then click `View` and `Show all extensions`. Double click on the green rectangle beside the name of the model to open it.
A new object window will open, clicking with the right mouse button will display a menu giving you access to explore the model. Have fun!
